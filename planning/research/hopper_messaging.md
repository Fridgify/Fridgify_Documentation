# Hopper - Notes

Hopper is a notification tool developed by colleagues. They offered us to use their service and as their service is compatible with our goal, we decided to give it a try.

## Current status

We have to wait for the official documentation to finally decide to go with the service. As far as we currently know now, We require a safe storage space for User-IDs as well as binary files/strings, which are required for encrypted communication. It seems like they have a feature, where people can subscribe multiple times to a service. We could use this functionality to enable subscriptions to multiple fridges.
