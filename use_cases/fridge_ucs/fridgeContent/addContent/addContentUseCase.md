# Fridgify

## Use-Case Specification: Add Content

## 1. Add Content

### 1.1 Brief Description

Every user is able to add items to a specific fridge. Each item has a certain volume value, a certain increment and a name. Items can be added manually as well as per barcode scanning.

## 2. Flow of Events

### 2.1 Basic Flow

#### Add manually

An item can be added manually. The user decides to add an item manually, so he chooses the according button. After clicking on the said button, a dialog opens up, asking him to add the required information. The information is being sent to the backend, where it is added to the database if it is not already existing. If the to be added item does already exist, the volume of the according item is being increased. After that, the user is being redirected to an update "Fridge Content Overview".

#### Add with Barcode Scanning

An item can be added by scanning the barcode of an item. The user chooses the button to add an item by barcode scanning. He is being redirected to a camera view, where he is able to scan the barcode. If it is being recognized, the item is being added to the database, after adding some more information. If it is not successful, the user is being redirected to the "Content Overview" and the flow for Adding Manually is being started. The user is being redirected to an updated version of the "Fridge Content Overview".

## 4. Preconditions

### 4.1 Authentication

The user has to be logged into the system. He has to be authenticated to be able to communicate with the backend, otherwise getting content is not possible.

### 4.2 Access Rights
