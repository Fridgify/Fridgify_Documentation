# PHASE 2 WEEK 11? - INSTALLATION

Coming closer to the end we want to give you the chance to check out our progress for yourself. Both our backend and
frontend reached a state we are proud to release. 

We prepared two tutorials explaining how you can deploy fridgify yourself. It is beneficial to start with the 
[backend](https://github.com/Fridgify/Fridgify_Backend#features). Following up with the 
[frontend](https://github.com/Fridgify/Fridgify_Documentation/blob/master/installation_frontend/frontend_installation.md)
be sure to enter your backend url that you set up. We are thrilled to hear how it went and always there for your questions.
Until then...

*Stay cool. Stay organized*<br/>
â€” Your Fridgify Team
