# Week 5 - Cucumber testing and feature files

Tests are crucial to keep up the quality of every project. It is therefore an essential part of **Fridgifies** focus. With Gherkin and feature files we strive to give everyone the opportunity to understand our test cases even without coding skills. An examples of this were added to the following use case specifications.

This week marks the first big milestone for the **Fridgify** team. A new chapter has started with the end of our planning phase. The database structure was defined and we decided which api endpoints to focus on. We are thrilled to start with the actual implementation of our ideas and want to bring first prototypes as soon as possible. 

But each claim has to be backed up. So we present you our database structure and api definition.
